      "description": "With my growth and recognition within the team, I had the opportunity to take on several projects that provided me with significant professional development. I worked on SLA, resolving bugs for the Aurora application, which uses Java Swing. In that same project, I worked on coding demands with Groovy, a language I had never worked with before, but was able to demonstrate good resilience.\n\nAs my knowledge of JavaScript increased, I took on a very important project. In the first phase, I modified the application's style, and in the next stage, I refactored the code. I conducted proof of concept tests to choose the appropriate technologies, and we decided to use NX for the monorepo, React + RxJS (to work with reactivity on the front-end), and CBOR for communication with the back-end, in order to have fast communication. The application is called Xviewer and aims to be a web viewer of X-ray exams.\n\nIn addition, to increase reliability in the applications, I placed great emphasis on unit testing and integration testing, and was able to demonstrate my work with BDD using Python.",
